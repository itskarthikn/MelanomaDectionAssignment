# MELANOMA DETECTION ASSIGNMENT
>Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.<br>
>It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.<br>  
>Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 

## Problem Statement
>A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.<br>
>To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.<br>
<br>

## Analysis Methodology
>• Data Reading/Data Understanding.<br>
>• Dataset Creation.<br>
>• Dataset visualisation.<br>
>• Model Building & training.<br>
>• Chose an appropriate data augmentation strategy to resolve underfitting/overfitting .<br>
>• Model Building & training on the augmented data.<br>
>• Class distribution. <br>
>• Handling class imbalances. <br>
>• Model Building & training on the rectified class imbalance data. <br>
